# Common VBA Execution Trace

## Service
Displays a compact

or a very detailed
![image](/assets/ExecutionTraceDetailed.png)
execution trace which includes all executed procedures which have BoP/EoP statements in an executed procedure or BoC/EoC statements in an executed part of code.

## Installation
This module is an optional component of the _Common VBA Error Handler_ (see the corresponding post [Common-VBA-Message-Services][5]. When used alone some more steps are required to install it.

- Download [fMsg.frm][1] and [fMsg.frx][2] and import _fMsg.frm_ (not required when the [mErH.bas][6] had already been installed)  
- Download [mMsg.bas][3] and import it (not required when the [mErH.bas][6] module had already been installed)  
- Download  [mTrc.frm][4] and import it
- Copy the following to any module with to-be-traced procedures:(not required when the [mErH.bas][6] module had already been installed)<br>
```vbs
Private Function ErrSrc(ByVal s As String) As String
   ErrSrc = "module-name." & s
End Function
```
Copy the flowing to any standard module (not required when the mErH module is installed):
```vbs
' ----------------------------------------------------------------------
' Deklarations for the use of the fMsg UserForm (Alternative VBA MsgBox)
Public Enum StartupPosition         ' ---------------------------
    Manual = 0                      ' Used to position the
    CenterOwner = 1                 ' final setup message form
    CenterScreen = 2                ' horizontally and vertically
    WindowsDefault = 3              ' centered on the screen
End Enum                            ' ---------------------------

Public Type tSection                ' ------------------
       sLabel As String             ' Structure of the
       sText As String              ' UserForm's
       bMonspaced As Boolean        ' message area which
End Type                            ' consists of
Public Type tMessage                ' three message
       section(1 To 3) As tSection  ' sections
End Type                            ' -------------------
' ----------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Usage
Code in any to be traced procedure:
```vbs
Private Sub Any()
    Const PROC = "Any"
    '...
    
    mTrc.BoP ErrSrc(PROC)
    ' any code lines

xt: mTrc.EoP ErrSrc(PROC)
    Exit Sub
    
eh: ' any error haning
End Sub
```
Attention: Never use Exit but Goto xt instead to ensure the EoP (end of procedure) statement is not bypassed.

## Note
This execution trace module an the error handler module have three main things in common:
1. Both use the _fMsg_ UserForm because of its flexibility
2. Both require for each concerned module a function which uniquely identifies a procedure
3. Both use BoP (Begin of Procedure) and EoP (End of Procedure) statements. The execution trace to trace the procedures start/end when executed and the error handler to maintain a _path to the error_
